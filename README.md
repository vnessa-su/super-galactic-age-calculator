# Super Galactic Age Calculator

#### Calculates the age, life expectancy, and next birthday of a user on different planets in the solar system.

#### By Vanessa Su

## Description

Based on the birthday and gender input by the user, their age and life expectancy are determined. Then based on the selection of planet, the app will return the current age of the user on that planet and the date of their next birthday on that planet. It will also return the estimated years left to live on that planet based on life expectancy on Earth or how many years above life expectancy they've lived if they have already exceeded their projected life expectancy.
